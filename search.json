All the overseas operations, of the now defunct Cyprus Popular Bank, are also held by the legacy entity, until they are sold by the Special Administrator, at first Ms Andri Antoniadou, who ran the legacy entity for two years, from March 2013 until 3 March 2015. She tendered her resignation due to disagreements, with the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank Board members, who amended the lawyers of the legacy entity, without consulting her. Veteran banker Chris Pavlou who is an expert in Treasury and risk management took over as Special Administrator of the legacy entity in April 2015 until December 2016. The legacy entity is pursuing legal action against former major shareholder Marfin Investment Group.\",\n  'is_supporting': False}]\n\n\n\nimport tiktoken\n\ndef token_len(text: str, model: str = \"gpt-4\") -&gt; int:\n    encoder = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)\n    return len(encoder.encode(text))\n\npprint(paragraphs[0]['paragraph_text'])\nprint('Token length: ', token_len(paragraphs[0]['paragraph_text']))\n\n('The Commonwealth of the Philippines (; ) was the administrative body that '\n 'governed the Philippines from 1935 to 1946, aside from a period of exile in '\n 'the Second World War from 1942 to 1945 when Japan occupied the country.

I guess it’s more of an article and less of a blog entry)\nThe motivation behind this series of posts is twofold, to run a basic knowledge graph Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) benchmark I can build off of and iteratively improve, and secondarily, to give the reader a ride-along of the process, from choosing a benchmark, creating a knowledge graph, connecting the knowledge graph to a vector store, and so forth. I am going to break down the components of not only a RAG system, but also introduce the necessary parts of any LLM workflow - so there will certainly be something for everyone. You are free to use the table of contents to skip around to what interests you most, or embark on an end-to-end marathon read.\nI fully believe in democratizing the ability to build and test your own LLM tools, as they are a critical frontier of artificial intelligence. That is the path towards progress and away from the centralization of these fantastic technologies."

It also allows you to augment the LLM output through context-stuffing. The amount of tokens you can stuff into your context is not limitless, and so you can’t merely stuff all of your documents and tables into it. Out of this limit emerge dozens of RAG techniques which try to hydrate the prompt. The fine folks at Langchain have illustrated a small portion of these techniques here(Fig 1). Even with the promise of a 10 million token context window, there is no abatement of upcoming RAG techniques and companies built around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Soiree of RAG techniques\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: Langchain blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ever-growing survey of these techniques exists - and even that is not fully exhaustive.

    "text": "1.2 Knowledge Graphs\nIt’s much easier to illustrate than explicate what a knowledge graph is(Fig 3). Below, we have a knowledge graph that represents places, people, and things along with their relationships to one another. This is a directed graph, in the sense that the connections flow in one direction - this generally makes it easier to specify the relationships between entities. There are many names for the entities within a knowledge graph as well as the connections between them; one of the most common naming conventions for them are nodes for the entities such as “Bob” or “The Louvre” and edges for the connections between the nodes such as “was created by” or “is located in”. Additionally, these nodes and edges can both have properties or attributes - for instance, the ‘Museum’ node can have attributes that enrich it such as “capacity: 2,000” and the edge ‘visited’ can be assigned a date attribute “date: March 28th, 2005”. You’ll often hear the word triple in reference to two nodes connected by an edge(Node A, Edge, Node B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An example of a basic knowledge graph.\n\n\n\nKnowledge graphs are often created within graph databases such as Neo4j, memgraph, or Amazon Neptune. They are often used within enterprises to integrate data from structured and unstructured databases alike to enable a single source of truth or knowledge. In theory, they are fantastic tools for information storage and retrieval, however, in practice they have a lot of quirks that prevent many companies from using them. The distillation of a company’s data into a neat set of nodes and edges is a complex task that requires knowledge graph experts, as well as alignment from all corners of the organization.\nWhile the appeal of knowledge graphs is immense because it appeals to our intuitive sense of informational organization and structure, you can see for yourself how difficult the task is by trying to organize the things on your desk into a knowledge graph. Your brain has no problem with making sense of it all and maintaining its own knowledge representation of what’s in front of your nose, but reproducing it in a knowledge graph is not as straightforward as our intuition leads us to believe.\n“Are you done sh*tting on knowledge graphs, Dmitriy?”\n\n1.2.1 LLM Synergy\nYes. In fact, here I am proudly generating a knowledge graph for the world to see.\nReal-time knowledge graph creation with GPT-3.5 Turbo Using:@LangChainAI @visjsPanel from @HoloViz_org for handling interpreter/browser bidirectional communication pic.twitter.com/P4mtAZDMaP— dmitriy (@DmitriyLeybel) February 18, 2024 \nIt may seem like this is the start of an all-hands meeting that’s 45 minutes too long, but I promise you that it’s not(unless you want it to be?). The word ‘synergy’ is perfect for describing the relationship between LLMs and knowledge graphs. The lowest hanging fruit for this match made in heaven was writing queries. Given a schema, an LLM can query a graph database to retrieve information.\nSome graph databases can be queried with Cypher(a graph querying language):\nMATCH (n:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-&gt;(m:Person)\nWHERE n.name = 'Alice'\nRETURN n, r, m\nIf you’re familiar with SQL, you immediately see the similarities. This query returns the person node n with the name Alice and all of the people(m) she knows(r). Fortunately, LLMs are superb at query languages, so your Cypher prowess can be minimal to nonexistent in order to compose this masterpiece:\n\nyo chatgpt, this is my graph db’s schema:schema here I need you to write a Cypher query that returns all of the people Alice knows\n\nCool. Now we can fire all of these data analysts, right? Maybe next year. (DISCLAIMER: this is a joke, not business advice)\nQuery generation turns out to be fairly popular, with frameworks like Langchain and LlamaIndex creating modules to do just that. Turns out, using LLMs, we can not only build queries, but we can build the knowledge graph itself. I will later go over this at length, so to be brief, you can have a LLM go over a set of documents chunk by chunk and output these triplets of nodes and edges iteratively. After loading them into a graph database, you can end the process there and trot along with your newly minted database, or you can now let the LLM create queries against that database as described earlier.\n\n\nLangchain and LlamaIndex also have their own plug-n-play knowledge graph creation modules.\nAt this point, like any rational human being, you may be asking, can this get any better? I mean, you’ve lasted this long, so I imagine that you already know the answer."

    "section": "1.3 RAG + Knowledge Graphs",
    "text": "1.3 RAG + Knowledge Graphs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember, there is more than one way you can skin a cat. The examples provided are merely the ones I believe are most illustrative of the main components. The extent of the composability is only limited by your imagination.\n\n\nWhen you combine RAG with knowledge graphs, you get the best of both worlds. On one hand, you get a fuzzy(probabalistic) semantic layer which can be used to compare the essence of sentences or paragraphs to via embeddings. On the other, you have a discrete and symbolic representation of knowledge. That sounds an awful lot like humans – vibes-based logical processors.\nThere are limitless ways to construct a system that exploits both modalities, so I’m going to focus on the base cases. The fundamental relationship takes place between the vector embeddings and the knowledge graph. The nodes(and in some cases, the edges) are linked to an embedding related to their source material.\nThe first objective is to use an LLM to create the knowledge graph in conjunction with the embeddings. The embeddings will be stored in a vector database or vector store, which is essentially an optimized container that allows extremely fast vector comparison operations so you can quickly find the most similar embeddings. Some vector databases live in the cloud(Pinecone), they can be self-hosted(Chroma), or they can stay in your very program’s memory(FAISS). Fig 4 illustrates the fundamentals of generating your knowledge graph and vector store.\n\n1.3.1 Generating Knowledge Graphs and Populating Vector Stores\nOnce a corpus of documents is chunked into pieces, those pieces can be processed by the LLM and converted into triples which are then loaded into the knowledge graph. Concurrently, embeddings are created for the document chunks and loaded into the vector store. In each case, you can attach the reference for the node or embedding in its respective twin – this is where the magic lies. The text from the chunked documents can be stored in either the knowledge graph or in the vector store, or both. Once both are established, there are multiple retrieval strategies we can use to take advantage of this system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBuilding the knowledge graph sounds simpler than it is, and just as the architectural design of these systems, it is open to myriads of potential options – some good, and some not so good. This will be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Knowledge Graph and Embedding Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Retrieval Strategy #1 Focused on Embeddings Search Followed by Knowledge Graph Adjacency\nWith a populated vector store and knowledge graph, we are set to experiment with a wide array of retrieval strategies in pursuit of finding the best one to hydrate our prompt. Fig 5 involves using the vector store to find the nearest matching embedding, find its reference in the knowledge graph, and then find the adjacent nodes within the knowledge graph to add to our prompt. This makes intuitive sense because concepts related to the initial node are likely to be relevant for the LLM in addressing the user’s query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: One strategy of retrieval through first finding a close embedding, and then utilizing the adjacency of nodes in the knowledge graph to hydrate the prompt\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Retrieval Strategy #2 Focused on Graph Query Generation\nAnother retrieval strategy would switch the knowledge graph and vector store steps around. This will involve an extra call to the LLM in order to construct the query we’ll send to the knowledge graph. Once the nodes(and edges) are returned, we can trace the node to its referenced embedding, and retrieve the neighborhood of embeddings along with their text. Alternatively, we can ignore the embeddings and simply focus on the neighborhood of the returned nodes. For the example in Fig 6, I’ll focus on the former. As much as we both love flowcharts, I have a feeling you’re getting somewhat tired of them. That said, here’s one more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Another strategy for retrieval is to generate queries against the graph database containing the knowledge graph, and then."

A single-hop requires the information from a single document to answer a question, however a multi-hop task requires you to hop between documents in order to answer the question. HotPotQA appears to be the most popular multi-hop dataset. Mentioned immediately on the HotPotQA website is another dataset which they shout out as newer, with a more diverse set of hops required, while including the HotPotQA dataset within it - BeerQA(is anyone else thirsty…). It combines QA data from three datasets, being HotPotQA, SQuAD, and its own formulated questions from Wikipedia for even more hops. Upon further inspection, BeerQA specifies that it primarily focuses on a fullwiki evaluation, that is to say, you must use the entirety of wikipedia in the task. Due to time and resource constraints, we do not currently want to build a knowledge graph from a 24GB dataset from the get-go. We do, however, want to be able to iterate in a quick and agile manner. HotPotQA doesn’t have the same compute-heavy requirement, and neither does another amusingly named dataset."

Another dataset was created as an improvement over HotpotQA as well as its successor, 2WikiMultihopQA – MuSiQue(Multihop Questions via Single-hop QUestion Composition) improves over its predecessors and includes questions with upwards of 18 distractors and numerous gold paragraphs in order to create questions of up to 4 hops. In addition, it handles some cases that would’ve allowed cheating within HotPotQA(such as inferring the information that is present in the hops). In addition, MuSiQue adds answerability to the mix – roughly half of the questions are unanswerable given the data, with the breadcrumbs provided by the provided distractors being misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great augmentation because this is the type of eval that will often be present in the real world, since we often expect real world retrieval of information retrieval to come up short.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Answerable and Nonanswerable Multihop Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuSiQue contains two evaluations, one with only answerable questions, and the other, evenly divided between non-answerable and answerable questions.

Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport.[citation needed] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit of trophies. In modern times, trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas.[citation needed]',\n   'is_supporting': False},\n  {'idx': 16,\n   'title': 'Safari School',\n   'paragraph_text': 'Safari School is a BBC Two reality television series presented by Dr Charlotte Uhlenbroek in which eight celebrities take part in a four-week ranger training course in the Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa.',\n   'is_supporting': False},\n  {'idx': 17,\n   'title': 'African Safari Wildlife Park',\n   'paragraph_text': 'The African Safari Wildlife Park is a drive through wildlife park in Port Clinton, Ohio, United States.

The following chart is from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena where models go head to head in answering questions which are then chosen by users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of performance and cost among top models\n\n\n\nOn the far right, we have GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus neck to neck as the highest performing models. As of this writing, the latest GPT-4 Turbo model actually overtook Claude 3 Opus. At the very top, we see Claude Haiku, which performs slightly below one of the GPT-4 models, but at an incredibly low cost. All of the Claude 3 models have a 200,000 token window and a 4096 token output – this is comparable to the 128,000 GPT-4 token window with a 8196 token output. Claude 3 Haiku will be model we’ll be using. If there are any hurdles with that particular model, it will not be too difficult to pivot by simply changing the endpoint to GPT 3.5 or GPT 4.\nHere is Claude 3 Haiku writing a haiku about itself:\nArtificial mind,\nSeeking to understand, learn,\nServe with empathy.\nAre you impressed yet? Maybe a little scared?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Claude had the very large context window months before GPT-4, the jury is out on whether it has been useful and robust enough for production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Claude Tokenization\nUnfortunately, Anthropic has not released a tokenizer that we can use, however, it is generally safe(famous last words lol) to assume that it is quite similar to the OpenAI one. Here, someone has attempted to reverse engineer it by counting the token amounts of the generations streamed to you.\n\nBut we’re not going to do that."

    "section": "5.1 Strategy",
    "text": "5.1 Strategy\n\n5.1.1 Sliding Windows\nTo answer the questions asked in the MuSiQue benchmark, we will create a unique knowledge graph for every individual question, consisting out of the twenty provided paragraphs. Each paragraph can be arbitrarily divided into multiple chunks of text which the LLM can take as input into its context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Each question contains multiple paragraphs, and each paragraph is made out of multiple text chunks.\n\n\n\nWe can use a sliding window to process the chunks of text that the paragraphs are composed of. There are numerous ways to insert variable amounts of text into the context of an LLM, but I’ll introduce the two basic approaches. You can do so with a sliding window that takes in one chunk of text after the other, or you can use a sliding window with some overlap. We’ll use the latter strategy, as it may help with continuity of the model’s understanding of the text. As the window slides across the text, we want to generate the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I say ‘nodes and edges’, I also mean any attributes thereof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Sliding window with overlap tends to be the standard approach when inserting text into LLMs\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Knowledge-Stuffing\nConnections are the bread and butter of knowledge graphs. If our LLM is producing nodes and edges only from our limited context window, it appears that we’re missing out on the connectivity benefit of knowledge graphs. To increase the connectivity of our knowledge graph, we can inform our LLM of previous nodes and edges it has created by passing them into the context of the LLM. Conveniently, this gives me the opportunity to introduce our composition of the context we’ll be using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: We provide the LLM with the system prompt, text chunks, and previously generated nodes and edges\n\n\n\nInside of the prompt we have our:\n\nSystem prompt: Contains the necessary instructions for priming the model(e.g. “you are a brave and beautiful graph creator”), as well as formatting in the case where we want JSON returned to us that represents the nodes and edges, and anything else we’ll need.\nPreviously generated nodes and edges: By knowing the previously generated nodes and edges, we can use them to update or create new nodes and edges that may or may not be related.\nText chunks: The text from the paragraphs which the LLM will be converting to nodes and edges.\n\nUnless we’ll be including all of the nodes and edges into the prompt, it still feels a bit limited. Technically, we can just shove all of those connections into the prompt, as there’s ample space with our huge 200,000 token limit, but we want this method to generalize and scale to tasks outside of this particular dataset.\n\n\n5.1.3 Letting the LLM Loose\nConsider the knowledge graph obtained after we process the 20 paragraphs pertaining to one question using the previously discussed method. We’d get something like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Sparsely Connected Knowledge Graph\n\n\n\nThe facts we obtain from the text chunks will likely be connected in fairly atomic clusters as there wouldn’t be great continuity, even with passing some of the previously computed nodes and edges into our context window. One way to fix this would be to feed random sets of nodes(and/or edges) to the LLM and let it generate new connections between the nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Building New Connections\n\n\n\nThis can be done in one of two ways(more, actually):\n\nPush the nodes and edges(and attributes) into the context window and tell the model to blindly make associations based on that information alone.\nAlong with the nodes and edges, push the segments of text that contributed to the creation of the nodes and edges alongside them. This gives the LLM more grounding and reduces hallucinations.\n\nWe’ll focus on the latter, as it pairs well with the vector store approach we will be discussing later."

    "text": "2.1 graph_analyst_template\nThis is the main system prompt template. It’s going to inform the LLM of its purpose, the format we expect it to return to us, the format of what we send to it, and any history we want it to take into account when generating its response.\n\n2.1.1 Instructions (Pydantic and JSON Schema Magic)\nTo programatically build a knowledge graph, the output of the LLM will have to be very specific and in a format we can easily process. Foundational models like Claude 3 excel at processing code and various formatted specifications. The specification that’s of interest to us is the JSON Schema, which is designed to describe the structure of JSON data. Here are some examples of this specification. It describes the fields, their types, and any particular data structures you need in your JSON.\nI trust you’ve perused the examples and are not too stoked to write all of that out yourself. Well, you won’t have to because we can express the same thing in a cleaner pythonic format using the Pydantic library – it makes structured outputs a breeze. In fact, there are entire libraries, like Instructor that are centered on using Pydantic to generate structured output from LLMs that help you validate the output against the schema specification.\nThe nodes and edges we need to construct for the knowledge graph aren’t overly complex, but they do have their nuances and enough moving parts to warrant a systemic approach to their production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The node-edge structure we construct from the outputs.\n\n\n\nEach individual node has an identifier, a category, a variable number of attributes, the source text it was created from, and an identifier of the paragraph it was created from taken from the dataset itself. The LLM won’t have to generate all of the properties, as the paragraph ID is simply taken from the paragraph that creates it; in fact, it can probably be a list of IDs where that particular node is referenced. The edges are a degree simpler, as they just need a category, some attributes, and the nodes which they connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPydantic, along with a similar sort of workflow can be generalized for structured extraction of any sort with LLMs. You define the JSON structure, feed the LLM a passage, and it extracts the fields you specified. This is a complete game-changer for machine learning and feature generation(much more exciting than chatbots, IMO).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you’ll see each class represent a distinct JSON object, with the fields and instructions that the model will receive. By using the BaseModel superclass😎, we can create Pydantic classes with the following syntax:\n\n\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Union, Tuple, Optional\nimport json\n\nclass Node(BaseModel):\n    semantic_id: str = Field(..., description=\"The unique identifier of the node that is \\\n                             a reference to create edges between different nodes.\")\n    category: str = Field(..., description=\"The category of the node\")\n    attributes: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, int, bool]]] = Field(None, description=\"Additional properties of the node\")\n\nclass Edge(BaseModel):\n    from_node: str = Field(..., description=\"The id of the node from which the edge originates.

It combines the Node and Edge classes into lists, as we want the final output to be a collection of nodes and the edges that connect them. model_json_schema() outputs the JSON schema of the format we want the LLM to return.\nIt may be worthwhile to read through the fields and their descriptions carefully, and mind the semantic_id in the Node class; its purpose is to allow the LLM to use that identifier in the from_node and to_node fields of the edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can probably use Pydantic classes to describe the JSON output we need without even generating the JSON schema. Such is the magic of LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to our fancy JSON schema generated with Pydantic, which already includes some descriptions of the fields, we need to pass in some instructions.\n\n\n\njson_rules = \\\n\"\"\"We need to create a JSON object that contains a list of nodes and edges that connect the nodes.\nBoth, nodes and edges, have optional attributes.\nYour goal is to extract as much pertinent information from the passage as possible and create nodes and edges with the extracted information.\nIf history is provided, it will be in the JSON schema you are given.

Doing this allows for the knowledge graph to grow more dynamically as it processes more information.\nFor example, if we have two separate chunks of text that the LLM is exposed to at different times, considering that there is some adjacency between the processing of the passages, since we won’t keep the entire history of nodes and edges in the context window.\n\nFido ran over the bridge\n\nand\n\nFido was hungry and stole a donut.\n\nThe semantic_id that identifies Fido would persist, so that the particular entity wouldn’t be duplicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The semantic id allows for continuity of the entity ‘Fido’\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Content\nIn addition to the JSON formatting instructions, we give the model some high-level guidance.

The mistaken identity shouldn’t be very common, but it can occur."
